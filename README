== DESCRIPTION

The ANSI project is a collection of ANSI code related libraries
enabling ANSI code based colorization and stylization of output.
It is very nice for beautifying shell output.

This collection is based on a set of scripts spun-off from
Ruby Facets. Include are Code (used to be ANSICode), Logger,
Progressbar and String. In addition the library include
Terminal which provides information about the current output
device.


== FEATURES/ISSUES

* ANSI::Code can be used as a mixin or as module functions.
* Good coverage of standard ANSI codes.
* Windows support needs some TLC :(


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

The ANSI::Code module defines ANSI codes as methods.

   include ANSI::Code

   p red, "Hello", blue, "World"
   => "\e[31mHello\e[34mWorld"

   p red { "Hello" } + blue { "World" }
   => "\e[31mHello\e[0m\e[34mWorld\e[0m"

Thes mehods can also be called as module methods, eg. 'ANSI::Code.red'.

Please see the online documentation for more information on using
the other libraries.
